      <header>Blon Bl-03</header>
      <p>BLON BL-03 Earphones adopts the carbon diaphragm 
        dynamic driver which can fully reduce the strong 
        human voice drum point of mid-low frequency, restore
        a shocking low frequency sound effect. You can fully
        enjoy a magnetic bass experience.</p>
      <p>How do the BLON BL-03 connect to an audio device? They connect
         via a detachable cable with a 3.5mm connector.
         </p>
      <p>What devices are compatible with these headphones? They are 
        compatible with most smartphones, music players, and computers, aren't they?</p>
        <p>Maintenance:
          How should the headphones be cleaned? It is recommended to clean
           the headphones regularly with a soft, dry cloth to prevent the
            accumulation of dirt and earwax.
          </p>
          <p>What kind of care should be given to the cable? Care
            should be taken not to bend or twist the cable excessively,
             which can damage the internal wires.</p>

    <!-- Audio Play Back-->
    <section class="main-section" id="Kirsite_Mirror_Polished_Metal_Shell">
      <header>Audio Playback</header>
      <p> What does the carbon diaphragm produce? It produces
         vibrations that generate sound.</p>
      <p> What type of music sounds best with these headphones?
           They sound good with a wide range of genres, but they excel
           in music with present and detailed bass.</p>
      <p>The dynamic driver, which is 10mm,
              provides a balanced and detailed sound.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Ergonomic_Design">
      <header>Ergonomic Design</header>
      <p>The earphone is mold based on professional ear canal data analysis. 
        The special shape is comfortable for long time wearing too and at 
        the same time it can increase the passive noise reduction effect.</p>
        <p>It’s improved by adjusting the angle and position of the sound tube 
        to the ear canal, achieving a high fit.</p>
      <p>The ergonomic design is like a snug, audio-hugging pillow for your ears. 
         The fit is secure, even during long listening sessions, and they're 
         incredibly lightweight, so you won't be doing the IEM shuffle.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Supreme_Quality_Cable">
      <header>Maintenance and Care</header>
      <p>Who should clean the earphones? All users 
        should clean their earphones regularly.</p>
      <p>What does regular cleaning do? It prevents the
           accumulation of earwax and dirt, which can affect sound quality.</p>
      <p>The cable, which is detachable, must be handled with care to avoid damage.</p>

        <li class="lista">But there is main con, The cable that comes with the BLON-03 
          could use an upgrade. It's a bit on the flimsy side, so you 
          might want to invest in a sturdier option.</li>
        <li class="lista">These IEMs are well-suited for a variety of music genres, 
          thanks to a warmish sound signature. They can rock out with 
          the best of them, but also lend themselves to mellower tracks.</li>
